					<h1>ABOUT THE EDWARDSVILLE ROTARY CRITERIUM</h1>
					<p class="about-p">Now entering its fourth year, the Stifel Nicolaus Edwardsville Rotary Criterium, a series of high-speed bicycle races on the closed-off streets of Downtown Edwardsville, Illinois on Saturday, August 17, 2013, is one of the region’s most exciting one-day events.
				<p class="about-p">
					The Edwardsville Rotary Criterium includes the following activities: High Speed Bike Races on Main Street from 3:00 p.m. – 10:30 p.m. Live Music from 5:00 p.m. – 10:00 p.m. in front of the Courthouse Four Free Kids Races starting at 6:45 p.m. Open Containers Perimeter on Main Street 3:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m.
				<p class="about-p">
					 The Rotary Club of Edwardsville began hosting this unique signature event in 2010 as a fund-raising effort for community-enhancing projects and as a gift to the people of Edwardsville. Because Edwardsville is a bicycling city that loves big events and opportunities to show off our Downtown, a bike race was a perfect fit.
				<p class="about-p">
					Edwardsville is a vibrant, bike-friendly, mid-sized college town, located just 25 miles from St. Louis, MO. With scores of unique local restaurants, shops, bike trails, parks and other cultural amenities, and home to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, as well as the Seat of Madison County Government, Edwardsville is an interesting place to live, work, eat, drink, bike, study or just visit. It’s also perfectly situated at the nexus of seven separated bike trails that comprise the 115-mile MCT Trails system, a scenic inter-connected bikeway system that is lauded as one of the most extensive of its kind in the country.</p>
